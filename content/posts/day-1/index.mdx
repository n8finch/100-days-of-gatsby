Welcome to the first #100DaysOfGatsby challenge!

### Challenge 1: Create a Gatsby Blog from Scratch

Why share all of your ideas with just Reddit and Twitter? Your best writing needs a home - on your very own blog!

This week, let's get a Gatsby blog up-and-running from scratch. You'll get practice setting up your local environment, creating new pages from React components, sourcing content from Markdown files, and deploying your site to a host!

If you are new to Node.js or React development, a Gatsby blog is a terrific project to start with.

_Bonus_: Use your new blog to track your #100DaysOfGatsby progress! Research shows that writing about what you learn, or even what you're struggling with helps you to retain that information, or even discover a solution. So, during your #100DaysOfGatsby journey, we encourage you to use this blog to write about your ups and downs, victories and challenges.

### Challenge Resources

To create your blog, start with our [beginner-focused Gatsby tutorials](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) and complete lessons 0-8. Depending on your current skill level, building a Gatsby blog may take you an afternoon or a full week (or more) to complete.

If you are already familiar with Gatsby's APIs and conventions, and want a more advanced challenge, you can [create a Gatsby theme for your blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/theme-tutorials/).
